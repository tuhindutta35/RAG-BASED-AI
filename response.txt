What's up? I'd be happy to help you out.

So, you're curious about "what is after video 23" in our CSS-Display-Property course?

Well, let me check... Ah yes! In video 24 of our CSS-Display-Property course (which starts at timestamp 676.92), we'll be diving into the world of embedded previews!

You can find it by going to the Sigma Web Development Course playlist and clicking on the "CSS-Display-Property-Sigma-Web-Development-Course" video number 2, then finding the timestamp 676.92.

If you want to learn more about how this works in practice, you might also want to check out some of the other videos in the series, like video 3 (CSS-Media-Queries-Sigma-Web-Development-Course) where we discuss media queries behind the hood!
